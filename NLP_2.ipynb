Unfortunately, injuries have taken their toll, thrusting Ronel Blanco into the rotation temporarily. As a starter this season, he's thrown 17.0 innings. In that time, he's allowed 17 hits, nine walks, five homers, and nine earned runs. His road ERA is 6.30, mostly due to one disastrous relief appearance in April...

            "\n",
            "Please find the information on the role of the supplements we take during the program.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Supplements are high quality nutritional support assisting to Heal & Repair our Gut. The three key reasons we have the supplements are:\n",
            "\n",
            "- The primary reason is to balance your hormones – particularly your insulin levels. (Insulin being responsible for fat uptake in the cells – especially your liver cells). Once your hormones are balanced your body can in fact learn to lose weight and efficiently, and keep it off. As well as with the weight loss you will find your moods become much more stable, anxiety levels decrease, your skin becomes clearer, your head and your thoughts become clearer, and your energy levels will soar (no more naps in the afternoon – it’s very liberating).\n",
            "\n",
            "- Secondly the nutrition is responsible for cleaning your Gut. The vast majority of illnesses today stem from poor gut flora. Our program will clean up your Gut, allow your villae (finger-like protrusions on the inner wall of your intestine responsible for increasing the surface area for absorption of nutrients into your bloodstream) to stand up and work to their full potential.\n",
            "\n",
            "- Thirdly, the nutrition is responsible for keeping your skin’s elasticity after the weight loss. (This does depend on how much weight you need to lose, we have had some people lose 60-80kg, and as a result they may need further assistance and treatment for their skin)\n",
            "\n",
            "This is why supplements are important. The nutrition in the supplements is responsible for supporting your gut. Our program will support your gut, allow your villae (finger-like protrusions on the inner wall of your intestine responsible for increasing the surface area for absorption of nutrients into your blood stream) to stand up and work to their full potential.\n",
            "\n",
            "The supplements we use for the program are manufactured by M?dere which is well known for using superior products. Their stringent testing is commendable. M?dere products also have a massive absorption rate, up to 90%. Their products work in synergy with each other, which is the reason they are so effective. And they’re all toxin and chemical free, plant based and most importantly they are not weight loss medicines.\n",
            "\n",
            "This program is a gut-healing program that is extremely successful in such a short time frame due to the synergy between the high absorption quality supplements & the alkaline meal plan. They work hand in hand so that you don’t cause long-term damage & nutritional deficiencies. The awesome results you achieve are because the incredible nutrition works so well with our Alkaline meal plan.\n",
